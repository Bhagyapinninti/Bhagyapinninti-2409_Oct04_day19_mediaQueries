    <h1>CSS Properties</h1>
    <div class="object-fit">
        <h2>The CSS object-fit Property</h2>
    <p>
      The CSS object-fit property is used to specify how an img or video should
      be resized to fit its container. This property tells the content to fill
      the container in a variety of ways; such as "preserve that aspect ratio"
      or "stretch up and take up as much space as possible".</p>

      <p>
        Here is where the object-fit property comes in. The object-fit property can take one of the following values:</p>

      <ul>
       <li>fill - This is default. The image is resized to fill the given dimension. If necessary, the image will be stretched or squished to fit</li>
      <li>contain - The image keeps its aspect ratio, but is resized to fit within the given dimension</li>
      <li>cover - The image keeps its aspect ratio and fills the given dimension. The image will be clipped to fit</li>
      <li>none - The image is not resized</li>
      <li>scale-down - the image is scaled down to the smallest version of none or contain</li>
      </ul>
      </p>  

    </div>

<div class="position">
    <h2>CSS position Property</h2>
    <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>static - Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow</li>
        <li>absolute - The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element</li>
        <li>fixed - The element is positioned relative to the browser window</li>
        <li>relative - The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position</li>
        <li>sticky - The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
            A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).</li>
    </ul>

</div>
<h2>CSS display Property</h2>
<p>The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.</p>
<ul>
    <li>inline - Displays an element as an inline element. Any height and width properties will have no effect. This is default.</li>
    <li>block - Displays an element as a block element. It starts on a new line, and takes up the whole width</li>
    <li>inline-block - Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values</li>
</ul>
